Had trouble with Card module read and show (because I'm a total idiot)
Task: A simple card guess game, game spec included in project spec pdf
Program has 3 main functions: initialGuess, nextGuess and feedback, each has a role which has been explained very detailed in the spec
Method of Card guessing part is a very basic weighting calculation, which will minimise the possibility for the next guess, thus saving time

A pretty simple task yet I have spent days on it and hours on a stupid code error and some indentions
